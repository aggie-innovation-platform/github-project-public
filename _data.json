Functionality has been folded into Node core.\n\nThis brings up another topic: how to migrate to new Node versions? I think a lot of bionode is from the \"v0.12 era\"? I've been using the LTS Node 4 for web projects currently. But the new versions bring in some really sweet ES6 features, and I think bionode is less susceptible to  \"complex environments that find it cumbersome to continually upgrade\" [[1](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/community/node-v5/)] and so should be OK to use the latest stable release. But I guess also, should try to stick to LTS as long as the stable features aren't super worth it. I heard that they are trying to match up v6 with V8 5.x or so for something like 95% ES6 support, so thats something nice to look out for.\n","closed_by":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bionode/fasta-parser/issues/1","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bionode/fasta-parser","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bionode/fasta-parser/issues/1/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bionode/fasta-parser/issues/1/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bionode/fasta-parser/issues/1/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bionode/fasta-parser/pull/1","id":179084469,"number":1,"title":"Raise

Bionode data analysis tools and pipelines should run on distributed high performance computing servers for big data but also locally on user machines for browser web applications (e.g., genome browsers).\r\n- **Use Streams**: The core architecture of the code should be based on Node.JS Streams. This allows to process data in realtime and in chunks with self-regulation though backpressure (i.e., if one step is slow, the whole pipeline adjusts). For example, while you are downloading a data set, you could be analysing it before the download is complete without worrying about latency and timeouts issues. In practice this means Bionode pipelines would use less computing resources (memory and disk space), do the data analysis in realtime and finish faster than other approaches.\r\n\r\n## Short term - what we're working on now\r\n- Funding for full-time development\r\n- Showcase data analysis pipeline\r\n\r\n## Medium term - what we're working on next!\r\n- CWL integration\r\n- Dat integration\r\n\r\n## Longer term items - working on this soon!\r\n- C++ integration\r\n- Workflow GUIs\r\n- BioJS integration\r\n\r\n## Achievements\r\n* [x] Prototype code and tools\r\n* [x] GSoC

submitted with BioJS](http://biojs.net/gsoc/2015/), projects for [GSoC2015](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015). Unfortunately, BioJS wasn't accepted as an organisation this year (Google didn't accept many previously accepted organisations, and accepted new ones, which is fair).\nHowever, those projects can still be carried by anyone interested in them, or by students looking for a projects.\nThe following is a copy of the Bionode projects listed on the BioJS page. If you are interested, please reply here or at [gitter.im/bionode/bionode](http://gitter.im/bionode/bionode). You can also send me an email at [mail@bmpvieira.com](mailto:mail@bmpvieira.com)\n# Bionode Pipeline Building GUI\n## Rationale & Approach\n\nMaking a easy to use graphical user interface to build interactive pipelines would lower the barrier of entry to usage of Bionode to non-bioinformaticians/programmers. This could be achieved through integration with projects like [Galaxy](http://galaxyproject.org), however a more interactive/advanced interface such as [Node-RED](http://nodered.org) is what we are aiming for. Another good source for interface inspiration would be the [NoFlo](http://noflojs.org) project. [Node-RED](http://nodered.org) or any other open source project can and should be used/adapted as much as possible instead of writing a new interface from scratch.\n\nThe resulting interface should produce as output a descriptive text file representation of the pipeline, that should be able to run on the command line without requiring the GUI. For example, [Gasket](https://github.com/datproject/gasket), [datscript](https://github.com/datproject/datscript), [hackfile](https://github.com/mafintosh/hackfile) or [Makefile](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#toc-An-Introduction-to-Makefiles).\n## Challenges\n- Integration between available interfaces and bionode pipeline\n- Producing a simple text format representation of those pipelines for easy versioning, distribution and collaboration.\n## Involved Tools / Libraries\n- Node-RED\n- NoFlo (for ideas)\n- Galaxy (for ideas)\n- Gasket, Datscript, Hackfiles, Makefiles (for text representation of pipeline).\n## Needed Skills\n- Backend JavaScript/Node.js\n- Frontend JavaScript\n- Bash\n- CoffeeScript (for NoFlo)\n## Mentors\n\nBionode team (contact: Bruno Vieira)  \n- [Boris Adryan](http://logic.sysbiol.cam.ac.uk/): Scientist: @FlyJedi, genome gazer.

It would be interesting to combine both tools to solve a biologically relevant problem while testing and solving issues with the integration between both projects.\nFor example, one interesting use case is to use Bionode to get transcriptomic data from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) for any species/experiment and visualise the expression levels of genes with BioJS. During your project you should be able to work on at least three different use cases.\nAs the data might become larger for specific files (e.g. SAM/BAM) one should be able to use streams to communicate with Bionode modules\n## Challenges\n- Getting several modules from both projects to work together\n- Might require some architectural changes to those modules.\n## Involved Tools / Libraries\n- Bionode\n- BioJS\n## Needed Skills\n- Frontend JavaScript\n- Backend JavaScript/Node.js\n## Mentors\n\nBruno Vieira (Bionode) and Miguel Pignatelli (BioJS)\n# Bionode distribution on HPC Grid\n## Rationale & Approach\n\nBionode pipelines can currently only run on one machine, but we would like them to be able to scale and be distributed across nodes of a high performance computing cluster (HPC). There are several ways to distribute Node apps across several CPUs/Machines using native Node.js or libraries but for a scenario were the user does not have administrative access to the cluster and must rely on established queuing tools (i.e., Sun Grid Engine) integrating/wrapping Bionode around those tools might be the best approach.\n## Challenges\n- Development will require access to a cluster of several machines or a simulated environment. We already have a [Docker container that provides Sun Grid Engine](http://github.com/gawbul/docker-sge).\n- If the student is interested in using Node.js queuing/distribution libraries, it will require a review of the existing options and adapting to bionode pipelines.\n- If the student has more interest or experience with other queuing systems, it will require wrapping those systems with bionode/node.js code.\n- We only expect the student to do one approach, but a very skilled student could do both.\n## Involved Tools / Libraries\n- Node queuing systems\n- Other queuing systems (i.e. SGE)\n## Needed Skills\n- Node.js/JavaScript\n- HPC experience\n- Docker (could be useful for development)\n## Mentors\n\n[Steve Moss](http://about.me/gawbul) and [Max Ogden](http://maxogden.com/)  \n# Bionode modules\n## Rationale & Approach\n\nThere are [several modules that would be useful for bionode](https://github.com/bionode/bionode#list-of-modules) that can be grouped in:\n- Data access (from web APIs)\n- Data parsing/wrangling\n- Tools wrappers\n\nThe student could work on improving an existing module or writing from scratch a module that has been requested. If the student is interested in several small modules, improving their architecture and integration among themselves and other UNIX tools could have a huge impact on the usability of the project.\n## Challenges\n\nThe challenges will depend on the module(s) the student is interested in, but there are enough options to adapt to a very diverse range and level of skills.\n## Involved Tools / Libraries\n- Depends on the module, but everything from web APIs (e.g., NCBI) to command line tools (e.g., SAMTOOLS).\n- Node.js/JavaScript\n## Needed Skills\n\nJavaScript/Node.js\n##

this task:\n\n``` javascript\nconst switchFileType = (str, type) => {\n  // probably nicer with a regex replace..\n  const pieces = str.split('.')\n  pieces.pop()\n  return pieces.join('.') + '.' + type\n}\n\nconst throughUppercase = through(function (chunk, enc, cb) {\n  cb(null, chunk.toString().toUpperCase())\n})\n\nconst uppercaser = task({\n  input: '*.lowercase',\n  output: '*.uppercase',\n  name: 'Uppercase Transform'\n}, ({ input }) => \n  fs.createReadStream(input)\n    .pipe(throughUppercase)\n    .pipe(fs.createWriteStream(switchFileType(input, 'uppercase')))\n)\n```\n\nThe `operation` for this task will return a writable stream. Then `dup.setWritable(operation)` will apply it to the task duplexify stream. Similarly for readable.\n\nThen in the [catchTask](https://github.com/bionode/bionode-waterwheel/blob/efb1bd5031b8902e692e297c45192832dbc7474d/lib/reducers/task.js#L415-L448) action, the purpose is to resolve once the operation has completed. It's called \"catch\" because it stops the task lifecycle action pipeline until the operation is completed, so that then [resolve output and validate output](https://github.com/bionode/bionode-waterwheel/blob/efb1bd5031b8902e692e297c45192832dbc7474d/lib/Task.js#L69-L71) can be ran.\n\nAfter output is successfully validated (file is not empty, etc.), I set an `_output` object in the duplex stream, and destroy the stream:\n\n``` javascript\nfunction finish(uid) {\n  stream._output = getTask(uid).resolvedOutput\n  stream.destroy()\n  // TODO not this\n  // 'destroy' may as well be 'breaksCompatibleWithStreamsModules'\n  stream.emit('destroy')\n}\n```\n\nOn `destroy()` the duplex stream emits a `close`. Then the lifecycle of a task is something like:\n\n``` javascript\nuppercase()\n  .on('destroy', function() {\n     console.log(this._output) // object with absolute path of output\n  }\n```\n\nand `join` will use that to run tasks after each other, collect all the outputs into the \"output dump\", etc.\n\nHowever, this breaks if the `operator` itself throws a `close` event, as what happens with child processes. My solution to this was (which only switched to the `emit('destroy')` hack [recently](https://github.com/bionode/bionode-waterwheel/commit/8e43d1b6a1459d932d239f26ed42aa622989c7f6) as I was hacking features into refactored code) was to add a function to the stream object, which could access things through a closure, and would run the output resolution and validations inside that function. On any \"ending type\" event - end, close, finish, you could call it. So the lifecycle for a task was:\n\n``` javascript\nuppercase()\n  .on('close', function() {\n     const output = this._output() // runs output resolution and validation now, but \"outside\" the task\n     console.log(output)\n  }\n```\n\nWhich is better because it uses no made up events, but a little annoying because if you just do\n\n``` javascript\nmyTask()\n```\n\nif will not actually run the whole task lifecycle until `this._output()` is called. Perhaps a `taskWrapper` could auto call this, and then itself emit a `close`. \n\nIdeally:\n\n``` javascript\nsomeTask() // whole lifecycle contained inside here\n  .on('close', // or some otherwise standard event, end, finish, etc\n    function(this) {\n      console.log(this._output) // prepared resolved+validated output\n   })\n```\n\nThis way task lifecycle is contained in one place without doing weird wrappers that would themselves need to emit `close`, and the resolved output is available immediately when a task is \"done\". \n\nI saw mention of a flush function, but perhaps only for a writable stream?\n\nAlso, `operations` which are actually just duplex streams, like a transform, can be set as the duplex inside `task` and forking/parallel should work as if `task` is a regular `duplex`; so the \"catch finish\" need not apply since no output files need to resolved to absolute paths.\n","closed_by":{"login":"thejmazz","id":1270998,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1270998?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejmazz","html_url":"https://github.com/thejmazz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejmazz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejmazz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejmazz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejmazz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejmazz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejmazz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejmazz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejmazz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejmazz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bionode/bionode-watermill/issues/33","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bionode/bionode-watermill","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bionode/bionode-watermill/issues/33/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bionode/bionode-watermill/issues/33/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bionode/bionode-watermill/issues/33/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bionode/bionode-watermill/issues/33","id":164721657,"number":33,"title":"{

[x] duplexify with async globby and set read/write stream later - didnt convert globby to promise yet, but tested async with `setTimeout`\n\n---\n\nFailed all test cases when I switched task from being a sync function to a `co.wrap(function * (){ .. })` - which returns a promise, but is nice because `yield`ing promises is nice. \n\nBefore:\n\n``` javascript\nconst task = Task(...)\nisStream(task) // true\n```\n\nafter:\n\n``` javascript\nconst task = Task(...)\ntask.then((stream) => isStream(stream) /* true */ )\n```\n\nThe reason it became async is for `globby` - I am checking the filesystem to see which files exist that match patterns in `input` and `output`. This may become negligible as tasks become able to pass values to each other. However, perhaps the performance impact of `globby.sync` _will not be negligible_ when running many tasks, or tasks that have many files.\n\nFor now, I am just going to use `globby.sync`. As well, [glob-stream](https://github.com/gulpjs/glob-stream) may be worth a try - will still be async but perhaps glob-stream can be piped into the main Task stream.\n\nAt some point, Task may need to have a stream that wraps a stream. So that you can stream in input object into, and stream out an output info object on a `.end` after the `.end`/`.push(null)` of the inner
